 * important, use a traditional event listener. The events contained in this class run at a priority of 50, which is
 * fairly low as event priorities go. If the event is async by nature, ie {@link AsyncPlayerConfigurationEvent}, then
 * the event will be run off of ticking threads. Otherwise, the even will be run on ticking threads. These handlers
 * ignore if the event has already been cancelled.
